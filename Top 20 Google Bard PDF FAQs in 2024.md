Although there is a plug-in called [Bard2PDF](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/bard2pdf-convert-bard-to/cckipgmmeajmmepnbgeldfmphdbcoini), it seems that comments require payment. Using the official plug-in mentioned in the article above does not require payment and is more convenient.

## **13. What’s the Bard’s PDF use that Gemini Pro or Gemini Ultra at 2024-01 ?**

As of now, **the Bard’s PDF is using Gemini Pro**

![**the Bard use Gemini Pro at 2024-01**](https://img.whynotbetter.com/whynotbetter/2024/02/454ee78e12dce908f317cebb3c59ffd3.png)

**the Bard use Gemini Pro at 2024-01**

This is what Google Bard told me personally:

> I'm able to engage in meaningful conversations and generate text thanks to Google AI's Gemini Pro language model, trained on a massive trove of text and code. I've been available in English across most of the world since December 6th, 2023.


> Unfortunately, Gemini Ultura is not yet available to the public. It is an upcoming language model from Google AI that is said to be even more powerful than the current Bard model. However, there is no information yet on how it will be used or when it will be released.


> In the meantime, you can continue to use Bard for your language needs. Bard is a large language model that can generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer your questions in an informative way. It is still under development, but it has learned to perform many kinds of tasks.


However, the good news is that Google officially confirmed:

> **Look out for Gemini Ultra in an advanced version of Bard early next year**
